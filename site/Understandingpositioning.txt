Positioning in Css

1. Static : It is the default positioning for all the html element will have when they enter on the page. So it says 
            "follow the other elements in the document flow" So whatever comes first in our html 
like is any div if written after h1 so it comes after h1.like that 

2.Relative:It is just like static but it allows you to do 4 specific things that static does not
 that u can change top, right, bottom and the left of an html element. when i write postion:relative nothing really happens
one the child (one) but when i specify left:10px then it moves itself by 10 px from left and overflows its parent too.
(see positioningTest.html in coursera file in c drive)
             
                 Relative allows you to change the position of the element relative to where it would be in the document 
flow if it was statically positioned. if there are elemens one after the other like one two three 
if i specify 
one{position: relative;  top: 20px;} then  one will overflow on two because relative position when apply top ,left ,right
bottom , it actually takes that elemnt out of the documnet flow and moves it down ,up,right or left. and 
prior whre the one was that place is preserved as it is now there but we moved it below 10 pixel(other elements act like elemnt one 
is there at his prior place)

In gernaral  you almost never going to using top,left,right and bottom on a position:relative elemnet   bcoz all that does is to move that elemnt 
out of the document flow & it become really difficult for the other element bcoz it will overflow on them .

3. Absolute : That is used for moving top,left,right , and bottom     
when i put like 
one {
position:absolute;
}
then The document just completely ignore the one element on the page and just the underneath elemnts(two & three ) will come up and takes it's 
position as like it was never before 
So absolute positioning does not preserves it's space
if we do like 
one
{
position:absolute;
top:0px ;
}
then it directly toches to top of the screen (it assumes all the screen)
Absolute position absolutly position an element inside of some parent conatiner that it can refernce
whever parent have positioned relatively/ absolutly/sticky/fixed it assumes it's screen uptill that 
by default all html elemnts positioned static(expcept <html>) so if the parent is static it doesn't consider it it goes all the way along until it find positioned
absolute/relative/sticky/fixed .So as we know <html> does not postioned static so here inour case the child one goes till tag <html>(it means the screen) so consider its container as html)  

Anytime you have a postion other than static, Absolute elements will use that as it's parent

4.Fixed-
It consider all the screen( completly ignores the parent relative/static or not)
If you place any element byusing fixed like
one {
postion:fixed;
top:0;
}
Something unique about the fixed elemnts they stay in the same place when u scroll down
the page big difference between absolute and fixed is fixed moves with the pages and remain 
same exact position on the page and also it positioned itself entire html page and not just its parent

sticky:
it has the combination on both relative and fixed
parent {
position: relative;
}

one{
position:sticky;
top:0;
}

it will remain just like relative but when we scroll down the page as soon as our page 
hits the top of our page since we set top:0 then one will stick to page and it becomes fixed to page now 
it stays top of our page.
